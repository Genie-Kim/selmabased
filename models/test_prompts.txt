A lighthouse stands tall on a rocky coastline under a clear blue sky. The lighthouse has red and white stripes and a bright light at the top. A sailboat passes by in the distance.
The beach is sunny with clear blue skies. The dog is a golden retriever wearing a red bandana. The dog is digging next to the sandcastle.
The city street is quiet and empty. The bicycle is a vintage model with a wicker basket. The bicycle is parked in front of the coffee shop.
A serene beach with golden sand at sunset. A child with a bright red balloon runs along the shore, leaving footprints. A playful golden retriever chases the child, barking happily.
A busy city street with yellow taxis and a towering skyscraper. A street artist paints a vibrant mural of a dragon on a large canvas. A curious black cat watches the artist intently from a red bench.
A cozy living room with a crackling fireplace and a bookshelf. An elderly woman with silver hair knits a colorful scarf in a rocking chair. A tabby cat sleeps peacefully at her feet, purring softly.
A snowy mountain peak with a panoramic view under a clear blue sky. A mountaineer in red gear plants a flag at the summit. A bald eagle soars overhead, casting a shadow on the snow.
A quaint village square with cobblestone streets and a historic fountain. A street musician in a blue hat plays a cheerful tune on a violin. A little girl in a yellow dress dances joyfully around the fountain, clapping her hands.
